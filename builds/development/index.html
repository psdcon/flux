                    also results in data only needing to be inputted once - a major time saver compared with

                    <p>Today’s business world is accelerating at an ever faster rate. Most traditional ERP systems
                    do not change from the day you purchase them, they are a sunk cost.</p>

                    <p>Flux is different - the core system will continue to be developed and upgraded free of charge.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, we have found that once companies get access to a digitised version of their
                    processes and data they rapidly develop new ways of doing things. Users know more about
                    their company than ever before, and catch problems when they start rather than at the end
                    of a reporting period. This leads them to suggest process improvements & additional
                    functions to enhance them & their company’s performance.</p>

                    <p>Uniquely Flux provides regular 6–12 month system reviews to see where the Flux system
                    can be further tailored for customer needs. This enables users to change the system to suit
                    their changing business needs – a large departure from traditional, static ERP systems.
                    Flux’s modular software architecture means that new functions & processes can be added
                    quickly with no business disruption.</p>


                    <p><strong class="uppercase purple">a fully transparent system</strong></p>

                    <p>Flux is based on the concept that a fully transparent workplace leads to greater worker
                    engagement and harmony. All user activity is monitored in real time with user reports
                    helping you identify your best team members and those who require extra attention.</p>

                    <p>Employee satisfaction improves as transparent recognition of achievement becomes the norm.
                    Freed from mundane tasks and empowered by easy real time access to all relevant company
                    data, staff become innovative and entrepreneurial.</p>

                    <p>If required you can also share analytics & data with your customers via the web portal.</p>

                    Flux’s core framework is for everyone. Specialisation arises from installing industry specific
                    apps on top of the core platform. If Flux have not already created the app your company
                    needs, then this will be done as part of the implementation process.

                    <p>Prior to the implementation of Flux, Comex McKinnon was a mid-tier Irish agricultural
                    supply chain management company with turnover of 1 108m, handling 450,000 tonnes
                    of product annually. Following the implementation of Flux in 2011, the company began to
                    grow rapidly. By 2013, the company had turnover of 1 203m, handling 1,000,000 tonnes of
                    product with one less employee. Due to Flux’s transparent nature, Comex was also trading
                    with less risk and increased profitability.</p>
